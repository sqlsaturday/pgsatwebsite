## Code of Conduct 
PGSaturday events seek to create a respectful, friendly, patient, considerate, and inclusive event experience, and an environment where all participants feel welcome.

We therefore ask all participants to honor this Code of Conduct. Any kind of disruptive, intolerant or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated, and we reserve the right to remove any participants who violate our Code of Conduct from the event.

We do not tolerate any harassment or discrimination. 

Please report any concerns, harassing behavior, suspicious, or disruptive activity to the event organizer or staff and send a copy to <a href="mailto:coc@sqlsaturday.com">coc@sqlsaturday.com</a>
